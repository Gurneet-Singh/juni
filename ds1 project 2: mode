INSTRUCTIONS:
Using your knowledge of dictionaries, extend your Simple Stats project to compute the mode. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. Note: there may be more than one mode if there are ties!

Bonus: Edit summary() so that it doesnâ€™t print anything, but instead returns a dictionary of statistics. Make the keys the names of the statistics and the values the actual stats. Then write a function that can print every entry of the dictionary on a separate line.
