INSTRUCTIONS:
A car company has been receiving constant complaints about the engines in their new car. Customers report engine overheating, so the company has compiled a table of the following data from these complaints. The Internal Temperature records the temperature of the engine when it was overheating.

Plotting the data could help identify which categories are most likely to be contributing to this issue.

Organize the data into lists, storing data from each category in ascending order. Then plot these lists against the corresponding Internal Temperature, displaying only one plot at a time in the cell. If there seems to be a clear linear relationship (a straight line) then the company will know to investigate these categories further.1

internal = [240, 260, 220]

plt.scatter(internal, coolant)

What categories are most likely contributing to this issue? Was there any data that wasn't useful?

Analysis:

as coolant increases, internal temperature also increases. as external temperature increases, internal temperature also increases. speed and age are a bit weird and there isnt a strong relationship. the patterns for both aren't linear. we didn't plot color because it's just a display and its not numerical.

other response (not mine): Both the engine coolant level and the external temperature seem to have a clear linear relationship with the internal temperature. Age and average speed didn't seem to have a clear relationship. Additionally, the color of the color can't be plotted since it is a categorical variable (non-numerical).
